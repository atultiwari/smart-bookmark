# Security Policy

- Do not commit secrets or API keys to the repository or expose them in CI logs.
- Users must configure their Gemini API key inside the extension Options page (stored with `chrome.storage.sync`) or route requests through a secure proxy service.
- Report security concerns by opening a private issue or contacting the maintainers directly.
